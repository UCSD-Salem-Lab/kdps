# Introduction

`KDPS` (Kinship Decouple and Phenotype Selection) is an R package that resolves cryptic relatedness in genetic studies using a phenotype-aware approach. It removes related individuals based on kinship or IBD scores while prioritizing the retention of subjects with phenotypes of interest.

This tool is useful in GWAS and epidemiological studies where maximizing the number of unrelated individuals with relevant traits is essential for statistical power, especially in rare or stratified phenotypes.

# Installation

To install the latest version from GitHub:

```{r,eval=FALSE}
if(!require("devtools")){
  install.packages("devtools")
  library("devtools")
}

if(!require("kdps")){
  devtools::install_github("UCSD-Salem-Lab/kdps")
  library("kdps")
}
```

# Example Data

This package includes two example files in `extdata/`:

### `simple_pheno.txt`

This file contains phenotypic data for individuals in the cohort. Each row represents one individual.

| Column   | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `FID`    | Family ID (used for linking with kinship data) |
| `IID`    | Individual ID |
| `pheno1` | A binary phenotype (e.g., disease status) |
| `pheno2` | A categorical phenotype used in prioritization |
| `pheno3` | A continuous trait (e.g., height or biomarker) |

Example:

| FID | IID  | pheno1   | pheno2    | pheno3 |
|-----|------|----------|-----------|--------|
| 0   | 1001 | DISEASED | DISEASED2 | 109.5  |
| 0   | 1002 | HEALTHY  | HEALTHY   | 117.18 |
| 0   | 1003 | HEALTHY  | HEALTHY   | 90.41  |
| 0   | 1004 | HEALTHY  | HEALTHY   | 95     |

---

### `simple_kinship.txt`

This file encodes pairwise relatedness between individuals based on genome-wide genotype data.

| Column    | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `FID1`    | Family ID of individual 1 |
| `IID1`    | Individual ID of individual 1 |
| `FID2`    | Family ID of individual 2 |
| `IID2`    | Individual ID of individual 2 |
| `HetHet`  | Proportion of sites where both individuals are heterozygous |
| `IBS0`    | Proportion of sites with no alleles in common |
| `KINSHIP` | Estimated kinship coefficient (values > 0.0442 typically indicate 2nd-degree or closer relationships) |

Example:

| FID1 | IID1 | FID2 | IID2 | HetHet | IBS0  | KINSHIP |
|------|------|------|------|--------|-------|---------|
| 0    | 1001 | 0    | 1002 | 0.037  | 0.0083| 1       |
| 0    | 1003 | 0    | 1004 | 0.046  | 0.0148| 1       |

# Simple Example: Resolving Relatedness in a Small Cohort

```{r,eval=FALSE}
library(kdps)

phenotype_file = system.file("extdata", "simple_pheno.txt", package = "kdps")
kinship_file   = system.file("extdata", "simple_kinship.txt", package = "kdps")

kdps_results = kdps(
  phenotype_file = phenotype_file,
  kinship_file = kinship_file,
  fuzziness = 0,
  phenotype_name = "pheno2",
  prioritize_high = FALSE,
  prioritize_low = FALSE,
  phenotype_rank = c("DISEASED1", "DISEASED2", "HEALTHY"),
  fid_name = "FID",
  iid_name = "IID",
  fid1_name = "FID1",
  iid1_name = "IID1",
  fid2_name = "FID2",
  iid2_name = "IID2",
  kinship_name = "KINSHIP",
  kinship_threshold = 0.0442,
  phenotypic_naive = FALSE
)

kdps_results
```

# Function Arguments

Key arguments for `kdps()` include:

- `phenotype_file`, `kinship_file`: File paths to phenotype and kinship matrices.
- `phenotype_name`: The column name of the phenotype to prioritize.
- `phenotype_rank`: Ordered levels from most to least important.
- `kinship_threshold`: Kinship score above which subjects are considered related.
- `fuzziness`: Controls tolerance when resolving complex networks (default = 0).
- `prioritize_high`, `prioritize_low`: If `TRUE`, prioritizes subjects with extreme phenotype values (numeric).
- `phenotypic_naive`: If `TRUE`, phenotype info is ignored and ties are broken randomly.

---

# Output

The output is a `data.frame` with columns:

- `FID`: Family ID of the subject to remove.
- `IID`: Individual ID of the subject to remove.

You can save this output to a text file to filter out individuals in your downstream analysis.

```{r,eval=FALSE}
write.table(kdps_results, file = "subjects_to_remove.txt", quote = FALSE, row.names = FALSE)
```

---

# Final Notes

- KDPS is designed for large-scale studies like UK Biobank, with efficient performance even on complex networks.
- Users are encouraged to interpret results in the context of potential **collider bias** introduced by phenotype-aware filtering.
- For large studies, consider pre-filtering unrelated individuals using tools like `PLINK` and using KDPS for final refinement.
